      <h3>WHY ALTSCHOOL</h3>
      <ol>
      <li><p>Well, after I left school I needed to do something that did not involve going out too much and altschool provided that.</p></li>
      <li><p>Also, Altschool africa offers a flexible way of learning, the payment option is very adaptable and relatively cheap compared to others.</p></li>
      <li><p>Another reason is the job opportunity that it could provide at the end of the course provided I am successful.</p></li>
